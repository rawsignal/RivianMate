## FAQ

### Why the limits on self-hosted?

Self-hosted is designed for personal and family use. The limits prevent unauthorized commercial use while covering typical household needs.

### Is the self-hosted edition really free?

Yes. No time limits, no nag screens, no telemetry. Core features work forever.

### What happens if I exceed the user limit?

New user registrations are blocked. Existing users continue to work normally.

### Can I upgrade later?

Yes. Your data is yours - you can migrate to cloud edition or continue self-hosting.
